# KoIso

Simple abstractions for working with country and language codes in kotlin.

Over the years I've dealt with multiple projects where I needed to handle country or language code information. There are libraries, csv files, json files, etc for many platforms but nothing really convenient and maintained for Kotlin multiplatform. 

This solves that and I plan to keep it fresh. The relevant standards change once in a while. If you notice something is out of date, please create an issue or pull request and I'll fix it.

## Features

- Country class to represent countries. Has all the common ISO 3166 codes. Based on [this project](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes). My intention is to copy upstream changes if/when they happen. Note. this data set is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. 
- Additional flag and phone dial prefix extension properties added via alpha2 code via this [gist](https://gist.github.com/devhammed/78cfbee0c36dfdaa4fce7e79c0d39208)
- TODO: add language code support (when I get around to this, PRs welcome).

## Gradle

This library is published to our own maven repository.

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven("https://maven.tryformation.com/releases") {
        // optional but it speeds up the gradle dependency resolution
        content {
            includeGroup("com.jillesvangurp")
            includeGroup("com.tryformation")
        }
    }
}
```

And then you can add the dependency:

```kotlin
    // check the latest release tag for the latest version
    implementation("com.jillesvangurp:ko-iso:1.x.y")
```

## Example

### Hello World

```kotlin
// resolves by numeric, alpha2, alpha3 codes. Case insensitive.
Country.resolveCountry("de")?.let { country ->
  println("${country.name} (${country.flag})")
  println("code: ${country.countryCode}")
  println("alpha2: ${country.alpha2}")
  println("alpha3: ${country.alpha3}")
  println("Phone numbers start with ${country.dialCode}")
}
```

Prints the following:

```text
Germany (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)
code: 276
alpha2: DE
alpha3: DEU
Phone numbers start with +49
```

This README uses [kotlin4example](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kotlin4example) so the examples should always be in a working state.   

## Multi platform

This is a Kotlin multi platform library that should work on all kotlin platforms (jvm, js, wasm, native, ios, android, etc).
